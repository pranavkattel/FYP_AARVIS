Divorcerates have been rising in Nepal in recent years. While divorce was once rare and taboo in Nepalese society, it is becoming more common, especially in urban areas. This article explores some of the main causes of divorce in Nepal.


## Causes of Divorce in Nepal

Our culture and tradition consider marriage a lifelong commitment. Nowadays, social values and norms are losing tradition and shifting more towards Western culture.

Previously, divorce was not considered as an option. Recently, divorce has been prioritized as an easy option to end an unhappy marriage.

Presently, women are educated and do not tolerate violence. They are willing to end an abusive form of marriage, unlike the tradition of the past. Women are also independent and can spend their happy lives without the support of any men.

Economic pressures and lack of financial stability are also major causes of divorce in Nepal.

Many couples are staying separately due to work abroad, which leads to an absence of communication and closeness in the marriage.

Sadly,domestic violenceis still a serious problem in Nepal. Now, many women are getting awareness about domestic violence and are choosing to end their marriages.

Another basic reason for divorce in Nepal is extramarital affairs. The increasing number of users of Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, etc, and the opening of dating apps are making it easier to engage in such affairs.

Some quick and immature decisions to get married result in the end of the marriage. They later realize that they are not suited for each other.

Mental health problems are a major issue in this new generation. Lack of socialization, urbanization, and many other factors lead to mental illness. These problems generate a big issue in a good relationship and lead to a toxic relationship. There is still an absence of awareness regarding mental health in our society, and those who are suffering from mental health issues are treated discriminately.

Intercaste marriages are still not acceptable in our society, and many marriage relationships are forced to end because of family pressures and societal pressures. It is still a great challenge in our culture to do intercaste marriages.

Family members who are not supporters of the marriage often play villainous roles in ending the marriage. This is also a major cause of divorce.

Navigating different religious or cultural practices within a marriage can be difficult without mutual respect and compromise.

Recent laws on divorce are more flexible to allow divorce for both husbands and wives equally. This makes it possible to leave an unhappy and unhealthy relationship and start a fresh life. These legal changes are also a major cause of divorce.

When couples find it harder to balance their career and marital relations, there is a huge chance that any couple may choose to end the marriage.

Sometimes, couples struggle to assist each other’s individual goals while maintaining their relationship.


## Conclusion

The increasing divorce numbers in Nepal reflect wider changes in the society of Nepal. Ending a marriage is always difficult; the easy acceptance of divorce has allowed many couples to end unhealthy relationships and search for happier lives.

However, the trend also reflects the necessity for better marriage decisions, relationship awareness, and family support facilities in Nepal. Addressing the causes of problems in marital relations may be possible to assist more couples in building strong, lasting marriages.

## Domestic Violence Law in Nepal – Legal Framework

Nepal has established laws to protect individuals from domestic violence and provide justice for victims. TheDomestic Violence Act of 2066is a crucial piece of legislation that defines domestic violence and outlines the process for addressing it.


## Filing a Complaint

If someone experiences domestic violence, they can file a complaint either verbally or in writing at the nearest police station, municipality, or local body. The police will document the complaint and, in severe cases, file a First Information Report (FIR) against the perpetrator.


## Steps After Filing a Complaint

Summoning the Perpetrator:Once a complaint is filed, the accused is summoned to the police station. If they fail to appear, they may be arrested.

Treatment of Victims:Victims with severe injuries receive medical treatment. Those suffering from mental trauma are provided with psychological counseling.

Efforts for Compromise:Authorities often try to mediate and resolve the issue within the family. This step aims to prevent the matter from escalating to the courts.

Court Proceedings:If mediation fails, the case is taken to the district court, where evidence is presented.

Interim Protection Orders:The court can issue protection orders to safeguard victims from further harm and provide them with alternative accommodations.

Compensation and Punishment:Offenders must bear the cost of the victim’s treatment and rehabilitation. They may also face fines and imprisonment. The law also punishes those who assist in committing domestic violence.

## Challenges in Addressing Domestic Violence

Despite the legal framework, several challenges persist:

Cultural Norms:The traditional concept of giving priority to patriarchal behavior often gives men more freedom and power, and gives more motivation for violence.

Underreporting:To protect the prestige of the family and due to threats and pressure, victims do not want to file a complaint against the perpetrator.

Institutional Barriers:Ineffective implementation of the law relating to domestic violence restricts justice to the victim.

Economic Inequality:Victims are dependent on the perpetrator financially, which makes it difficult to go against them.


## Conclusion – Domestic Violence Law in Nepal

The Domestic Violence Act of 2066 is the law that plays an important role in addressing domestic violence. However, ongoing efforts are not enough, and it is required to identify the root causes that perpetuate domestic violence.

Governmental and non-governmental institutions, civil society organizations, and society can make a safer environment for everybody, away from the threat of violence.

This article will guide you to know about divorce law in Nepal.


## Introduction – Divorce Law in Nepal

Divorce is a legal way to end a marriage, and it involves specific rules and steps. In Nepal, these rules are outlined in Chapter Three of the NepaleseNational Civil Codefrom sections 93 to 104. This article seeks to explain divorce laws and procedures in Nepal in a simple manner.


## Types of Divorce in Nepal

According to section 93 of the Civil Code 2074, couples can end their marriage whenever they both agree to a divorce. This process is fast, usually taking two working days, making it affordable and less stressful. However, divorces through mutual consent might not cover property or financial claims, affecting the spouse who is financially less secure.

If both spouses can’t agree, either one can ask the court for a divorce by filing a petition according to section 96. The reasons for seeking a divorce can include three years of separation, adultery, or physical and mental torture. The court looks at different conditions depending on whether it’s the husband or wife applying for the divorce, adding complexity to the legal process.


## Grounds for Husband to File for Divorce According to Section 94

The wife lived separately with her share of the property for three consecutive years without informing the husband.
The wife forces the husband out of the house.
Wife inflicting physical and mental torture on the husband.
Wife engaging in a sexual relationship with another man.

- The wife lived separately with her share of the property for three consecutive years without informing the husband.
- The wife forces the husband out of the house.
- Wife inflicting physical and mental torture on the husband.
- Wife engaging in a sexual relationship with another man.

## Grounds for Wife to File for Divorce According to Section 95

The husband abandons the wife without knowledge of her whereabouts.
Husband living on his own for three consecutive years without the wife’s knowledge.
Husband engaging in a sexual relationship with a woman other than his wife.
Husband inflicting physical and mental torture on the wife.
Husband remarrying without the wife’s consent.
Husband forcing non-consensual sexual relations on the wife.

- The husband abandons the wife without knowledge of her whereabouts.
- Husband living on his own for three consecutive years without the wife’s knowledge.
- Husband engaging in a sexual relationship with a woman other than his wife.
- Husband inflicting physical and mental torture on the wife.
- Husband remarrying without the wife’s consent.
- Husband forcing non-consensual sexual relations on the wife.

## Division of Property in Nepalese Divorce

Courts suggest mediation to settle property and money issues during a divorce. If mediation doesn’t work, the court can look into the finances, making sure both parties reveal all their assets.

If someone hides assets and gets caught, the court can transfer those assets to the other spouse. When dividing shared property and deciding on maintenance, the court considers factors like each person’s income and property, how long they were married, and their age and health according to section 99 of the National Civil Code.

In divorce situations, if a wife chooses financial support instead of a share in the husband’s property, the court can instruct the husband to give a one-time sum or regular alimony based on his income or assets.

Yet, if the wife remarries, the husband isn’t obliged to continue such financial assistance. Sections 99 and 100 establish this legal provision, providing flexibility in divorce settlements by taking into account the choices and situations of the involved parties.


## Step Wise Divorce Procedures in Nepal

Submit the Divorce Application: The first step involves filing a divorce petition in the district court, requiring the assistance of a divorce lawyer.
Serving of Summons/Notice: The court sends a summons or notice to the opposing spouse, who has 21 days to respond to the divorce petition.
Response to Petition: The opposing spouse appears in court to respond to the summons, either accepting or refuting the claims made in the petition.
Submission of Proofs: The court orders both parties to submit evidence supporting their claims, and a failure to comply can result in consequences.

Civilized Discussions and Settlement: The court may encourage spouses to settle through mediation, reducing divorce petitions based on minor disputes.
Information about Property’s Source of Income: If no agreement is reached, the court intervenes to divide property based on disclosed details and income.
Decision Execution: After the court grants the divorce, the affected party must file a petition for implementation with the relevant decision-enforcing department.

The requirement for documents depends on the parties to the court marriage. If the couple is Nepali, the document’s requirements are different, and so on for the Nepali and foreign couple.

Firstly, we will discuss the necessary documents for court marriage in Nepal between Nepali and Nepali.


## Documents for Court Marriage in Nepal – For Nepali and Nepali

The citizenship of both partners is the first requirement to start the court marriage process in Nepal. If you have lost your citizenship, the document that indicates your identity, like a license, a passport, can be useful to start the process.

It is the most important certificate for a court marriage in Nepal. An unmarried/single certificate is taken from the ward office of the permanent address. The certificate verifies you are single/unmarried to the present date and eligible to marry. This certificate must be taken by both the marrying parties.

It is not a compulsory document. If you are doing a court marriage process away from your home district, then only this document is required. If you both are from the same home district and you are processing the court marriage from such district, there is no necessity for this document.

But other than the above condition, you need this document. For example, if your partner is from the Chitwan district and you are from the Kaski district, but you want to process a court marriage from the Kathmandu district court, then one of you needs a temporary residence certificate.

If you are from the Kathmandu district and your partner is from the Chitwan district, and if you are willing to process a court marriage from the Kathmandu district court, then you don’t need to make a temporary residence certificate, as one of you is already a resident of Kathmandu.

A minimum of 15 15-day stay certificate is required to do a court marriage from the temporary certificate.

Any person who has Nepali citizenship can be a witness to your court marriage. Two witnesses are necessary to complete the court marriage process. Witnesses may be friends, relatives, or guardians.

This article is all about Nepal OpensForeign Investmentin Primary Sectors of Agriculture.


## Introduction to FDI in Agriculture

Foreign direct investment (FDI) refers to the investment made by a company or individual in one country into business interests located in another country. This type of investment involves a long-term relationship and control of the foreign business. FDI plays a significant role in the global economy, facilitating the transfer of technology, skills, and knowledge, and contributing to the growth and development of both the investing and recipient countries. In the following sections, we will explore the impact of FDI on various aspects of the economy and its implications for businesses and governments.

Nepal has recently embraced foreign investment in its primary agricultural sectors. The amendment, declared on January 4, 2021, by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies via the Nepal Gazette, signifies a departure from long-standing restrictions.

This article aims to explore the complexities of this policy change, analyzing its possible consequences, the worldwide conversation regarding foreign direct investment (FDI) in agriculture, and the unique context of Nepal’s agricultural setting.


## Evolution of FDI Policy in Agriculture

The Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Act of 2019, commonly known as the “negative list” for foreign investment, outlined sectors where foreign investment was not allowed.

However, a recent amendment has brought about a change, excluding large-scale industries that export a minimum of 75% of their production from sectors like poultry farming, fisheries, bee-keeping, fruits, vegetables, oil seeds, pulse seeds, dairy, and other primary agriculture areas.

The discussion on foreign direct investment (FDI) in agriculture involves various viewpoints. In the past, capitalist ideas were uncertain about FDI in agriculture, and socialist perspectives strongly opposed it.

However, a change occurred after the global food price increase in 2007–08, prompting interest from food-deficit countries, including Nepal, in using FDI for food security. This shift is influenced by factors like access to land, water, and environmental concerns.


## Nepal Opens Foreign Investment in Primary Sectors of Agriculture

Contrary to the belief that a lack of capital is the main hurdle in Nepal’s agriculture sector, motivated youths and corporations are actively investing. The government has also set up subsidized credit facilities for the agriculture sector.

The challenge lies in determining whether Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) can bring significant benefits, considering the existing political instability, landholding structures, and other obstacles to foreign investment.

The past three years were deemed politically stable in Nepal, boosting investor confidence. Nevertheless, recent political upheavals have sparked concerns, affecting the confidence of the business community.

Factors such as the structure of land ownership, labor costs, and other considerations make Nepal less attractive for significant Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Despite the political stability, only a limited number of foreign-funded agro- and forestry-based industries were registered in the last fiscal year.


## Framework for FDI in Agriculture

Creating a successful framework for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in agriculture requires implementing strong screening, monitoring, and evaluation mechanisms. It is important to balance attracting foreign investment with protecting national interests, particularly by restricting FDI in priority crops as outlined in the Nepal Trade Integration Strategy for export promotion.

Policymakers must prioritize establishing a safety net to prevent harm to small and marginal farmers, aiming to strike a delicate balance between encouraging FDI and safeguarding local interests. Nepal can benefit from valuable insights gained from other nations that have effectively managed the complexities of FDI in agriculture.


## Conclusion

Nepal’s decision to open primary agriculture sectors to foreign investment represents a remarkable shift with implications that extend beyond the agricultural domain. The potential benefits of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), like bringing in capital and technology, need to be considered alongside the real challenges posed by Nepal’s unique socio-economic and political situation.

As discussions globally evolve on FDI in agriculture, Nepal’s experience will offer useful insights into how foreign investment, sustainable agriculture, and national development interact in a nuanced way.

This article aims to provide a detailed guide on the steps involved in filing a complaint in Court in Nepal and starting civil cases in Nepal.

Filing complaints and initiating civil cases in Nepal involves a systematic and structured process governed by theMuluki Civil Procedure Code 2074. This article aims to provide a detailed guide on the steps involved in filing complaints in Court in Nepal and starting civil cases in Nepal. The focus will be on the legal framework, the steps in initiating a civil case, and the importance of adhering to specified timeframes and jurisdiction requirements.


## Initiating a Civil Case in Nepal

To understand the process of initiating a civil case, it is essential to distinguish between civil and criminal cases. Civil cases involve filing a formal complaint, known as a “plaint,” and submitting it to the court. The following steps outline the procedure for filing a civil suit in Nepal:


## Steps for Filing a Complaint in Court in Nepal

Step 1: Initiation of Lawsuit Filing

The process begins with the plaintiff submitting a formal written complaint, known as a plaint, against the defendant. This document should include details such as the court’s name, names and addresses of the parties involved, and relevant contact information. Proper jurisdiction is crucial for filing the case.

Step 2: Revocation in Civil Procedure

After the initiation of lawsuit filing, the civil procedure allows for revocation. If the plaintiff realizes their inability to provide sufficient evidence against the defendant, they can retract the complaint from the court before a final decision is reached. The request for revocation must be presented to the court where the civil proceedings were initiated.

Step 3: Notice to Defendants

Following the submission of the lawsuit, the defendant is given a reasonable opportunity to mount a defense. The court generates a notice within thirty days of the lawsuit filing, and the defendant is required to respond to the plaintiff’s claims. The defendant can seek an extension of the initial time limit expires.

Step 4: Submission of Defense

The defendant provides an official response, known as the defense, either supporting or opposing the plaintiff’s claims. This is presented in a legally structured manner in a court of law, critically assessing the plaintiff’s allegations.

Step 5: Date of Appearance

The submission of the defense leads to the court setting a date of appearance for both parties. This designates the day on which both the plaintiff and the defendant must be present in court. Following the collection of evidence, with court authorization, parties may be absent during subsequent civil proceedings.

Step 6: Individuals Mentioned in Written Records and Documents

Any individual mentioned in writings, deeds, defense, or other relevant documents related to the lawsuit, apart from the plaintiff and defendant, is termed Persons Mentioned in Written Records and Documents. If these individuals exist, they are treated as defendants and allocated a date of appearance in court.

Step 7: Waris

The term “Waris” refers to the representative of either the plaintiff or the defendant. To be recognized in court, representatives must provide a document certifying their authority. There are two types of representatives: general representatives confined to a specific case, and authorized representatives with legal capacity equivalent to the individuals they represent.

Step 8: Court Orders

Before reaching a final decision, the court issues various orders during the civil procedure. Interlocutory orders are decisions made during the ongoing lawsuit to prevent grave consequences. Final orders represent the conclusive judgment, concluding the lawsuit.

These steps outline the comprehensive process of filing a complaint in court in Nepal, emphasizing the importance of adherence to legal procedures, jurisdiction, and specified timeframes.


## Conclusion

Filing complaints and initiating civil cases in Nepal requires a thorough understanding of legal procedures, jurisdiction, and specified timeframes. This comprehensive guide provides insights into the steps involved, ensuring individuals navigate the legal system effectively. Adhering to the outlined procedures is important for a fair and timely resolution of civil disputes in the Nepalese legal context.

--- Content from https://meroadalat.com/liquidation-of-companies-in-nepal/#more-1671 ---

This article will give you all the informations relating to liquidation of companies in Nepal.


## Introduction to Liquidation

Liquidation is a formal business process where acompanydecides to shut down its operations and sell off its assets. The primary reason for this decision is often because the company can’t pay its debts or sees no viable way to continue its operations profitably.

By selling its assets, the company aims to generate cash to pay off its creditors and shareholders. Once the process is complete, the company typically ceases to exist, marking its end in the business world.

Liquidation can happen either voluntarily, where the company itself decides to wind up, or involuntarily, often initiated by its creditors or due to legal mandates.


## Legal Framework forLiquidation of Companies in Nepal

In the context of Nepal, the process of liquidation is governed by two primary laws:

The Insolvency Act, 2063 (2006):This legal framework outlines the procedures and regulations for dealing with insolvency issues, providing the necessary guidelines for companies facing financial difficulties.
The Companies Act, 2063 (2006):This act plays a vital role in regulating the liquidation of companies. It sets the parameters for how companies can initiate and execute the liquidation process.
The Bank and Financial Institutions Act, 2073 (2017):This law specifically addresses the liquidation processes relevant to banks and financial institutions in Nepal.

Understanding these legal foundations is essential when delving into the intricate world of liquidation, as they provide the necessary structure and guidelines for businesses and financial entities in Nepal.


## Types of Liquidation

There are two primary ways a company can liquidate:

The company chooses to wind up on its own, believing it’s the best decision for its future. It’s a planned and orderly process, understanding that it’s for the best. It’s all very cordial and organized.

This type of liquidation isn’t the company’s choice. External pressures, especially due to mounting debts, compel the company to close its doors. It’s not ideal, and often a bit messy, but it becomes unavoidable.

Knowing the differences between these two types of liquidation provides a clearer picture of the business landscape.

It’s essential for aspiring entrepreneurs and businesses to grasp these concepts, as it helps them prepare for potential challenges and make informed decisions in their future ventures.


## The Voluntary Liquidation Process

Check Financial Statements:Companies need to assess their finances, seeing how much they owe and how much they have.

Shareholder Approval:The company’s shareholders, essentially the company’s big stakeholders, have to agree unanimously on the shutdown.

Decide on a Liquidator:This is like hiring someone to handle the clearance sale for your store.

Inform Authorities:It’s essential to inform government bodies like OCR (Office of Company Registrar) and IRD (Inland Revenue Department) about the decision to shut down and provide details about who is the chosen liquidator.

Takes Charge: The liquidator then takes control, selling assets and paying off debts.

Final Report:After selling all assets and settling debts, the liquidator compiles a comprehensive report, which is then submitted to the OCR.

Company Closure:Once all these steps are completed, the company’s registration is officially terminated, marking its end.


## Compulsory Liquidation Process

Application to Court:The company itself, its owed creditors, or even its shareholders may approach the court, indicating that there’s a financial crisis.

Court Appoints Inquiry Officer:This officer acts as a financial auditor, meticulously examining the company’s financial records to ascertain the extent of its financial challenges.

Decision Time:Depending on the inquiry officer’s findings, the court decides the next steps. It could be immediate liquidation, restructuring, or even giving the company some more time to get things in order.

Liquidator Steps In:If the court decides that liquidation is the best route, the liquidator steps in, taking control of the company’s assets, selling them, and then using the proceeds to settle the company’s debts.

Company Restructuring

Instead of shutting down entirely, they chose to make some significant changes. This might mean teaming up with another company, bringing in new people to take charge, or introducing new stock options for investors.

By doing this, the company aims to get back on its feet, improve its financial situation, and continue serving its customers.


## Conclusion

Business is full of ups and downs, and sometimes companies face decisions that can be quite tough.

Liquidation is one such decision, it’s just a way for a company to settle its debts and close its operations in an orderly manner.

But it’s not the only option, companies can also choose to reshape themselves through restructuring.

These laws are instrumental in ensuring data protection and safeguarding the privacy of individuals in Nepal.


## National Penal Code 2074

The National Penal Code 2074 focuses on protecting personal privacy. This means you can’t secretly record conversations, take pictures without permission, or steal data.

If someone breaks these rules, they might find themselves in jail or be hit with a hefty fine. Everyone in Nepal needs to be aware of these codes and follow them.

These steps show that Nepal is serious about guarding the privacy of its citizens and ensuring that everyone uses technology responsibly.


## Data Act 2079

In 2022, Nepal recognized the necessity for a comprehensive law that would unify all previous regulations related to data collection. The outcome was the Data Act of 2079, which sets out clear guidelines for how data must be collected, utilized, and shared within Nepal.

This act was introduced to streamline and strengthen data management practices in the country, ensuring that personal information remains protected and secure.

Nepal’s commitment to enacting such laws underscores its dedication to safeguarding the privacy and security of its citizens’ data in the modern digital age.

If passed, this legislation could bring significant improvements in how electronic data is handled and protected in Nepal. It’s a clear sign that Nepal is actively taking steps to meet global standards and prioritize its citizens’ digital security.


## Challenges for Foreign Companies

Currently, it’s a bit unclear whether Nepal’s data protection laws apply to international companies that deal with data from Nepali citizens.

This has raised concerns among international digital businesses operating in the country. However, the new IT Bill might provide more clarity on this front.


## Breach of Data in Nepal

In Nepal, keeping private data safe is a big deal. If someone violates another person’s privacy, it’s not just wrong but also against the law. Collecting personal data without proper authorization or not disclosing the reason for its collection is illegal. S

haring an individual’s personal information without their consent can lead to legal consequences. Violators can face imprisonment for up to three years, a fine of up to thirty thousand rupees, or both.

If an individual believes they’ve suffered due to a data breach, they have the right to seek compensation in court. It’s essential to handle personal data with care and respect in Nepal to avoid legal repercussions.


## Conclusion

Nepal sees the importance of data protection and is actively improving its laws to keep data safe and private. With more people in Nepal using the internet, strong privacy laws are becoming even more essential.

Though Nepal is advancing in its data protection efforts, certain aspects of the Privacy Act require refinement.

Until these modifications are in place, it’s essential for individuals to exercise caution when disclosing their personal details online, given the existing framework of data security in Nepal.

This article guides you to all the provisions relating to foreign investment in hydropower in Nepal and also the latest legal provisions relating to it.


## Introduction– Foreign Investment in Hydropower in Nepal

Foreign Direct Investment(FDI) plays a pivotal role in the development of Nepal’s hydropower sector.

Nepal, blessed with abundant water resources and untapped hydroelectric potential, has emerged as an alluring opportunity for global investors with a keen interest in engaging in hydropower ventures.

In this article, we will look into the formal legal framework and productive investment prospects.


## Nepalese Legislation Governing Foreign Investment

Nepal’s legal structure concerning foreign investments is primarily governed by theForeign Investment and Technology Transfer Act of 2019(FITTA 2019).

This legislation categorizes foreign investors into two distinct groups: “Non-resident Nepali” and “foreigners.”

Both these categories are granted the eligibility to invest in Nepali hydropower projects, promoting an inclusive environment conducive to foreign investment.


## Investment Opportunities in Hydropower

Nepal presents a compelling investment prospect in its hydropower sector, backed by the presence of more than 6,000 rivers. This abundant water resource translates into a significant hydropower potential, reaching a staggering 83,000 MW, out of which 43,000 MW stands as economically viable.

The government’s focused plan for hydropower development is geared towards exporting electricity to countries like India and Bangladesh, where there is a strong demand for hydroelectricity.


## Equal Treatment for Domestic and Foreign Investors

Under Section 32 of the Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Act of 2019 (FITTA 2019), both domestic and foreign investors are guaranteed equal treatment.

This provision establishes a fair and level playing field for all, ensuring that no discrimination exists between local and international investors.

The legislation allows for the secure repatriation of profits to investors’ home countries, creating a stable and trustworthy investment environment.


## Single Stop Service Center

As per Section 23 of the Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Act of 2019 (FITTA 2019), all foreign investments, including hydropower projects, are required to undergo a streamlined process facilitated by the Single Stop Service Center.

This centralized hub expedites various services, including hydropower registration, approvals for foreign investment and loans, company registration, labor permits, and visa facilities.

The Center enhances Nepal’s investment climate, ensuring efficiency and ease of conducting business for both domestic and international investors.


## Nepal Investment Board Approval

Approval from the Nepal Investment Board is a prerequisite for hydropower projects in Nepal, especially those with a capacity surpassing 200 MW or an investment exceeding $6 billion.

This mandatory approval ensures that large-scale projects adhere to rigorous standards and regulations. On the other hand, projects with capacities below 200 MW must obtain approval from both the Department of Electricity Development and the Department of Industry.

These formalities serve as essential checkpoints, ensuring the meticulous assessment and supervision of hydropower initiatives in Nepal, promoting accountability, and maintaining the sector’s integrity.


## Procedure for Obtaining a License from the Nepal Investment Board

Application Submission

Foreign investors interested in hydropower investments must initiate the process by submitting a comprehensive application to the Nepal Investment Board, which includes a detailed project report outlining the venture’s scope and potential.

Executive Evaluation

The application undergoes a thorough evaluation conducted by the executive head of the Investment Board.

This evaluation assesses the project’s viability, scrutinizing various aspects such as financial feasibility, environmental impact, technological viability, and social implications. If the project is found suitable, the formal investment study process commences.

Advisory Committee Report

A specialized advisory committee, well-versed in the technological aspects of the project, conducts a meticulous evaluation.

Their assessment provides valuable insights into the project’s technical feasibility and helps in the decision-making process.

Meeting Request

Upon the completion of technical assessments, the applicant is invited for a detailed discussion.

This crucial meeting allows for a comprehensive dialogue, addressing any queries or concerns and ensuring clarity in project understanding.

## Conclusion

Nepal’s hydropower sector stands as a promising opportunity for foreign investors. The government’s dedicated efforts to foster an investment-friendly atmosphere, coupled with the transparent guidelines established in FITTA 2019, make Nepal an appealing destination.

With abundant water resources and escalating demand for electricity in neighboring nations, Nepal’s hydropower sector offers an alluring prospect.

## Sector Specification for Investment

In Nepal, before an investment company can register, it must clearly state the areas or sectors where it plans to invest. This requirement is important because it sets the stage for what the company will do in the future.

It also makes sure that the company’s plans match up with the country’s industrial goals. This allows the government to monitor which sectors businesses are targeting.

It ensures that companies start off with a clear direction aligned with national priorities.


## Foreign Investment Considerations

Investment companies that bring in foreign capital have to face additional examination. These firms need to clearly state that they will invest only within Nepal. They must present specific information about the final recipients of these investments.

This system safeguards Nepal’s economic interests and ensures that foreign investors contribute positively to the nation’s development.


## Sectoral Boundaries in Investments

In Nepal, companies can only invest in areas listed in the current Industrial Enterprise Act and those approved by the Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Act. These boundaries make sure that all investments fit well with Nepal’s growth plans and main objectives.

By defining these specific sectors, the government creates a structured approach to development. This also offers investors a clear understanding, guiding them on where they should and shouldn’t direct their investments.

It also provides clarity to investors, guiding them on where they should and shouldn’t direct their investments.

--- Content from https://meroadalat.com/blacklisting-process-in-nepal/#more-1647 ---

This article is all about the blacklisting process in Nepal and the condition of being blacklisted in Nepal.


## Introduction to Blacklisting

Blacklisting is a procedure where people or companies get identified/marked as untrustworthy because of acts they have done in the past. In Nepal, this is essential, specifically when discussing finance and buying things for the government.

If someone is blacklisted, it means they might have trouble getting certain services or chances in the future. It sets clear boundaries and warns others about those who might not follow the rules or meet their commitments.

This system helps businesses and institutions make informed decisions, ensuring they work with reliable partners. Understanding blacklisting is vital for anyone involved in business or finance in Nepal.


## Blacklisting in Banking Sector

Banks in Nepal use blacklisting as a tool to label individuals or companies who have financial wrongdoings. If someone doesn’t repay their loan or misuses the loan amount, they may get blacklisted. Being on this list means they might not get loans from other banks.


## Credit Information Bureau

The CIB is a key entity involved in the process of blacklisting. It was set up based on Article 4 of the Institution Registration Act of 2034. The main role of CIB is to keep track of credit-related data.

This includes details like the amount someone has borrowed, their address and information about any witnesses. If a person fails to pay back their loan, the CIB can put them on the blacklist.


## What Happens after being Blacklisted?

When an individual or business is blacklisted, they often face difficulties in securing loans from banks or financial bodies. They might not be eligible for the benefits provided by the government.

Being on this list can limit financial opportunities and may create challenges in planning for the future. It’s essential to manage finances responsibly to avoid such consequences.


## Blacklisting Process in Nepal

Banks are required to report to the CIB under the following circumstances:

When a loan hasn’t been paid back for over 90 days.
If the loan’s value is equal to or exceeds one million rupees.
If the bank has reasons to think that an individual has either misused the loan or hasn’t utilized the loan for the purpose they initially stated.

- When a loan hasn’t been paid back for over 90 days.
- If the loan’s value is equal to or exceeds one million rupees.
- If the bank has reasons to think that an individual has either misused the loan or hasn’t utilized the loan for the purpose they initially stated.
Banks must be attentive and ensure that their borrowers use funds appropriately. This not only safeguards the bank’s interests but also upholds the financial system’s integrity.


## Why Blacklisting Matters in Public Procurement?

Talking about the public procurement, if a supplier lacks ethical behavior, they can be blacklisted. This mechanism guarantees that only those vendors who keep honesty and reliability are given chances to work on public projects.

By blacklisting the suppliers that lack ethical conduct, public agencies make sure that taxpayer money is used appropriately. Blacklisting upholds the integrity of the public procurement process, ensuring that projects are completed successfully and with trust.


## Public Procurement Monitoring Office and Blacklisting

The Public Procurement Monitoring Office (PPMO) oversees public procurement in Nepal. It ensures all participants, from bidders to consultants, act ethically.

According to thePublic Procurement Act, of 2063 (2007), unethical behavior includes actions that negatively affect public procurement, such as engaging in anti-competitive practices, promoting corruption, or committing fraud.

Article 62 of this Act states that bidders must behave according to set standards. If they don’t, the PPMO has the authority to blacklist them.


## Criteria for Blacklisting in Procurement

The Public Procurement Monitoring Office (PPMO) has clear rules for blacklisting. An entity can be blacklisted if it:

Violate the ethical guidelines stated in Section 62.
Don’t fulfill their contract duties or deliver work that doesn’t meet the mark.
Get legally convicted for crimes tied to procurement.
Aren’t truthful about their skills or background?
Decline to sign a contract after their proposal is approved.

- Violate the ethical guidelines stated in Section 62.
- Don’t fulfill their contract duties or deliver work that doesn’t meet the mark.
- Get legally convicted for crimes tied to procurement.
- Aren’t truthful about their skills or background?
- Decline to sign a contract after their proposal is approved.
Blacklisting is a measure to ensure only trustworthy entities participate in public procurement. This process helps in safeguarding the interests of the public and maintaining the quality and integrity of the procurement system.

Before taking the serious step of blacklisting, the PPMO follows a set process:

They first send a letter to the concerned party, asking them to clarify their actions.
There might be a joint discussion or hearing about the issue.
The decision to blacklist is made after carefully considering all the evidence and explanations presented.
Once the decision is made, the PPMO the PPMO notifies the concerned party and the appropriate authorities.
If an entity ends up on the blacklist, the duration starts from the moment they’re prohibited from participating.

- They first send a letter to the concerned party, asking them to clarify their actions.

- Once the decision is made, the PPMO the PPMO notifies the concerned party and the appropriate authorities.
- If an entity ends up on the blacklist, the duration starts from the moment they’re prohibited from participating.
As for removing someone from the blacklist, the PPMO follows certain guidelines. Even after removal, the PPMO retains a record of that entity’s past actions. This record helps in future decisions, ensuring a fair and trustworthy procurement process for everyone.


## Blacklisting throughCheck Bounce

If someone’s check bounces, it needs to be presented for withdrawal three times before considering blacklisting. The bank then applies to the CIB for blacklisting.


## Conclusion

Blacklisting, a pivotal mechanism in Nepal’s financial and procurement sectors, stands as a symbol of responsibility and accountability. Whether it’s a bounced check, a default on a loan, or unethical practices in public procurement, the process underscores the importance of ethical behavior and commitment to obligations.

Institutions like the CIB and PPMO carefully monitor and enforce these standards, ensuring that the nation’s financial systems and public projects maintain their integrity. The blacklisting process in Nepal is an essential mechanism in Banking. The blacklisting process in Nepal helps in maintaining the financial security of the financial institutions. So, we can say that the blacklisting process in Nepal is a vital weapon for financial institutions.

This article leads you to all the required information relating to capital gain tax in Nepal.


## What is Capital Gain Tax in Nepal?

Capital Gains Tax in Nepal is a tax you pay when you sell anything, like property or stocks, for more money than you bought it for. This profit of extra money is called a “capital gain.”

So, if you bought a piece of land for Rs 11,000 and later sold it for Rs 16,000, that extra Rs 5,000 is your capital gain. The tax you’d pay on this profit is what we call Capital Gains Tax. This tax applies to immovable property such as houses, Land, Stocks, etc.

According to Nepal’sIncome Tax Actfrom 2002 ( 2058), you have to pay this tax when your profit from selling house-land crosses a certain amount. If your land or house is valued over 10 lakh, you have to pay some tax upfront. Before this law, there wasn’t a specific tax for profits made from just selling personal property.


## Capital Gain Tax in Nepal

Each country has its own rules about CGT, and Nepal does too. To understand it better, let’s look at what Nepal’s tax rules mentioned about this:

The 10-Year Rule

In Nepal, if you own a house or land for 10 years and sell it for up to 10 lakh, you don’t have to pay extra taxes on the profit. But if you sell other things like stocks after a year and make money, you will have to pay taxes on those earnings.

Land Tenure

According to the Land Act 2021, if a landowner and tenant agree that one gives up their land rights to the other, there are specific rules. They set the land’s price based on current market rates.

They also consider costs for land bought before a certain date. After all is settled, the land office puts the land in the new owner’s name.

Gift and Inheritance Rules

If a property is given as a gift or passed down through three generations, the person getting it doesn’t have to pay the capital gains tax. But, if they sell that property right away, they’ll need to pay taxes on the profit they make from the sale.

Passing Down Property After Death

After a property owner passes away, the property given to someone else is priced at its current market value. If that property is later sold, they use this price to figure out the taxes.

Property Transfer Amongst Spouse

In the Income Tax Act of 2058, Article 43 talks about how spouses can give property to each other. If you get property this way, you can claim costs linked to buying it.

The person giving away the property doesn’t have to pay taxes if the money spent and earned from the property are equal.

Responsibilities for Capital Gain

According to a rule in the Income Tax Act 2058, specifically Section 5 of Article 95(a), the Land Revenue Office collects taxes whenever people make money from selling properties.

These properties fall under a special category called taxable non-professional assets. So, every time someone buys or sells property, they need to let this office know by registering the transaction with them.


## Capital Gain Tax Rate in Nepal

Tax Percentages

Knowing how much tax you might have to pay when you sell your property is important. Understanding the tax helps you prepare and know how much money you’ll need to set aside.

The Time Factor

The amount of tax you owe depends on how long you’ve had the property. The longer you own it, the less you pay.

Owning for Over 5 Years

Let’s say you’ve had your land or house for more than 5 years. In that case, you’ll be giving 5% of your profit as tax. So, if you made a $100 profit, you’d owe $5 in tax.

Owning for 5 Years or Less

If you’ve owned the property for 5 years or less, from the fiscal year 2079 onwards, the government will charge you a higher tax. Specifically, the government will take 7% of whatever profit you make.


## Conclusion

In conclusion, Capital Gains Tax is a charge levied when you profit from selling assets such as houses or stocks. It has specific guidelines for capital gain tax in Nepal, with rates varying based on the duration of ownership.

It’s important to understand these regulations, particularly if you intend to sell yourproperty. The Land Revenue Office assists individuals in navigating these tax responsibilities.

This article gives you all the information regarding INGO Registration in Nepal and the complete process of registration including the documents required.

Social Welfare Act 1992, Social Welfare Council Rules 1992 and Social Welfare Council are the major Regulatory Bodies and Laws in Nepal.

Nepal has become the focus of many International Non-Governmental Organizations (INGOs) wanting to assist in its growth because of its developmental needs.

Nepal has set up a comprehensive legal framework to ensure that these INGOs align with its developmental objectives including Socialism, Poverty Alleviation, and Socio-Economic Justice as per the Constitution.


## Social Welfare Act, 1992, and Social Welfare Council Rules, 1992

The “Social Welfare Act, 2049” (1992) was enacted to promote the welfare and development of vulnerable Nepalese groups. The Act establishes a Social Welfare Council to coordinate, supervise, and promote social welfare activities in Nepal.

The Council is empowered to grant permissions to foreign non-governmental organizations (INGOs) wishing to operate within the country. INGOs must apply to the Council, which evaluates their proposals based on alignment with national interests.

The Act mandates financial transparency by requiring INGOs to channel funds through local banks and submit annual reports detailing their activities.

Essentially, this Act regulates and supervises INGO operations in Nepal to ensure alignment with national sustainable development goals.

The Social Welfare Council oversees the work of international groups or organizations in the country. The Social Welfare Council regularly updates different instructions regarding topics like how to make agreements, how projects are reviewed, and how the work of international groups is evaluated and checked.


## Key Steps for INGO Approval in Nepal

Seek approval from SWC

Every international organization needs approval from SWC to function effectively and legally in Nepal. This process makes sure that INGOs are helping Nepal to achieve developmental goals.

Enter into Agreements

There are two forms of agreement before approval of INGO operation in Nepal:

General Agreement

The INGO and SWC execute an agreement that lays out how the INGO will work in Nepal. It talks about important things like where they’ll help, how much money they’ll give each year, project proposal submission dates, and other must-do tasks. This agreement only lasts for a certain time and requires renewal after its expiry.

Project Agreement (PA)

The INGO, SWC, and local partners execute an agreement that talks about the details of specific projects. It covers subjects like what the project aims to do, how they’ll do it, how they’ll check on progress, and how much it might cost. It’s important for INGOs to talk with local people when making this agreement, so the project makes sense for the community and they’re on board with it.

Collaboration with Local Partners

International organizations in Nepal don’t work alone. They team up with local groups, which can be NGOs, Profit Distribution Companies, or any entity with a non-profit objective. Working together helps them get things done on the ground and understand local situations better.

Establish a local Office

International organizations in Nepal need to have a local office here. Even though this office is connected to the main organization and doesn’t stand alone legally, it still needs to register with Nepal’s tax authorities and acquire a Permanent Account Number (PAN).

Budget Allocation and Funding:

International organizations in Nepal require money to run. They have to get at least $200,000 every year from outside Nepal. Also, when they plan their budgets, they shouldn’t spend more than 20% of the total money on office and admin costs.


## Required Documents For INGO Registration in Nepal

Home Country Registration:A certificate that proves the organization is authentic in its home country.

By-Laws:If the given document doesn’t clearly say what the organization’s goals are, they’ll need an extra document that does.

Financial Promise:The organization needs to show it can provide at least $200,000 every year.

Project Plan:A concept paper or proposal about what the organization plans to do.

General Agreement Draft:This needs to be in a specific format the authorities ask for.

Authorization Letter:A letter that says who’s in charge of the agreement.

ID of the Person in Charge:A copy of their citizenship, passport, and some basic info about them.

Cover Letter:With a short intro or greeting.

Funding Source Info:Details about where the organization’s money comes from.


## INGO Registration in Nepal –Things to be Considered

Submission of Agreements on Time

International organizations in Nepal need to give in to the PA within three months after signing the GA. If they’re late, they might get fined, and sometimes, the GA can even get canceled.

Avoid Money-Making Businesses

International organizations in Nepal shouldn’t put money into businesses that aim to make a profit. They should focus mainly on helping and making things better.

Maintain Transparent Financial Transaction:

International organizations can give money to local groups, but they must secure SWC’s approval before accepting funds.


## Conclusion

INGO registration in Nepal is a very easy process. INGO registration in Nepal guides you to register and start the organization. Nepal is open to help from international groups, but it also makes sure its own needs come first. The rules they have to make sure these groups work in a clear and organized way. It also ensures these groups team up well with local organizations and respect how things work in Nepal. These rules help Nepal grow in a way that’s good for the sustainable growth and welfare of Nepali people.

This article will guide you through all the legal provisions regardingdivorcealimony in Nepal.


## Divorce Alimony in Nepal

Alimony is money that one spouse gives to the other when they get divorced or separated. If two people decide not to be married anymore, one of them might need some extra money to help with their living costs. This money helps them pay for things like food, a place to live, and other basic needs.

Alimony in Nepal is addressed under Article 100 of theNational Civil Code 2017, referring to it as “Spousal Support.”


## How Alimony is Decided in Nepal?

In Nepal, there’s no strict rule that says exactly how much alimony should be. Instead, judges look at a few things to decide. They are:

Judges consider stuff like family land or houses that have been passed down through generations.

This includes checking out how much money he has in the bank and how much he earns regularly from his job or business.

If the husband has borrowed money or has debts, the judge will also take that into account. So, based on these points, the judge tries to come up with a fair amount of alimony.


## Types of Alimony in Nepal

Here, the wife gets one big payment, which is based on what the husband owns and how much he earns every year. This is great for those who don’t want to take a part of the property but want a lot of support money all at once.

Sometimes, getting a divorce takes a long time, during this waiting time, the wife can ask for some money every month to help her out. This is like getting a small allowance while waiting for everything to be settled.

This is like getting a regular allowance after the divorce is done. The wife gets a certain amount either every month or every year. How much and how often depends on how much the husband earns and what the wife feels is best. But, if the wife gets married again, these payments stop.


## Who Can Get Alimony in Nepal?

Children from separated parents can get alimony, this support is given until they turn 18. But, if they go on to college or some other higher education and don’t have enough money, they can still get this help.

If two people were married and then decided to part ways, one of them might need some financial help. So, if one person can show in court that they really need this money to get by after the separation, they can get alimony.

Alimony is a way to make sure that even after a family breaks apart, everyone has some financial support to help them move forward.


## Maintenance and Alimony

In Nepal, “Maintenance” is the financial support a husband provides to his wife, especially if they’re separated but still married. This might be needed during tough times, like disputes or domestic violence.

The National Civil Code, 2017 (Article 100), says if a wife needs money for daily needs or health, she can seek maintenance. If he can’t fulfill this, the wife can approach the local municipality for assistance.

Alimony is financial help given after a divorce, it ensures the wife receives support once the marriage officially ends. In Nepal, distinction maintenance is supported during marriage, and alimony begins after divorce, providing the wife with continued assistance.


## Conditions for Alimony in Nepal

If a couple isn’t living together due to issues like domestic violence, the wife can ask for “maintenance” money since she might rely on the husband’s income.

If the husband harms the wife physically or emotionally, she can report it and live separately. During this time, she can seek maintenance.

The wife can ask for a monthly allowance based on the husband’s earnings until things are settled.


## Conclusion

In Nepal, when a marriage ends, it’s more than just two people deciding to part ways. It’s about making sure everyone, especially the wife and kids, will be financially okay.

There’s no set rule for how much money someone should get as alimony after a divorce. Instead, judges look at different things, like what the husband owns, how much he makes, and any money he owes.

Then, they decide on a fair amount, which can be given all at once or little by little. Divorce alimony in Nepal is a part of the divorce process under certain circumstances.

Licensing Route (Electricity Act Section 3):This two-phase process involves obtaining a survey license for feasibility, followed by a generation, transmission, or distribution license based on project viability.
Direct Government Agreement (Section 35 of the Electricity Act):Some entities enter into a direct agreement with the Nepalese government, although the exact scope and rights remain somewhat ambiguous.

The Registration of Foreign Trademarks in Nepal can be a confusing and difficult process at times. Various rules, regulations, and authorities govern foreigntrademarkregistration and can take months for the processes to be complete and for validation to initiate.

In this article, everything you need to know as a foreign Trademark registered in Nepal has been covered with details on the laws governing Foreign Trademarks, the complete procedures for registering the trademark, and the required documents for registering a Trademark in Nepal. In short, this Article shall act as a complete guide on the Registration of Foreign Trademarks in Nepal.


## Laws Governing Foreign Trademarks in Nepal

ThePatent, Design, and Trademark Act, of 1965is the governing legislation in Nepal for Trademark. Under section 21(a), this act clearly states that for foreign trade to have protection in Nepal, it must be registered there. So, just having a trademark from another country won’t extend its protection to Nepal.

Even though Nepal is a member of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Properties 1886, it doesn’t directly address the safety of “well-known trademarks.” Therefore, anyone who wants to protect their foreign trademark must register it with Nepal’s Department of Industry (DOI).


## The Registration Authority

TheDepartment of Industry (DOI), under theMinistry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, handles trademark registration in Nepal. They not only register trademarks but also administer them, ensuring that businesses can protect their brand identity effectively.


## Registration of Foreign Trademarks in Nepal– Complete Process

The process of Registration of Foreign Trademarks in Nepal is Systematic and follows a defined path:

Submission of Application:Begin with submitting your application to the DOI. This is the foundational step where you express your intent to register your trademark in Nepal.
Preliminary Examination by DOI:The DOI then conducts a thorough examination to ascertain if the proposed trademark is already registered or if it goes against any prevailing laws.
Publication in the Industrial Property Bulletin:Once cleared by the DOI, the trademark is then published in the Industrial Property Bulletin, which is generally issued every three months
Final Registration:If no third party raises an opposition within 90 days of publication, the trademark gets registered.

- Final Registration:If no third party raises an opposition within 90 days of publication, the trademark gets registered.

## Required Documents for Trademark Registration in Nepal

Home/Foreign Registration Certificate:This serves as evidence of your trademark’s registration in its home country.
Label of the Trademark:Four colored prints are needed for the registration process.
Application of Registration of Foreign Trademarks:This documents your intent to register your trademark in Nepal.
Power of Attorney:This gives authority to a local person in Nepal to file the trademark application on your behalf.

- Application of Registration of Foreign Trademarks:This documents your intent to register your trademark in Nepal.
- Power of Attorney:This gives authority to a local person in Nepal to file the trademark application on your behalf.
Remember, if you’ve applied for a trademark registration in a foreign country, this application can be used to claim priority for up to six months as per the Paris Convention’s provisions.


## Classification of Trademark in Nepal

TheNice Agreement of 1957divides trademarks into different groups in Nepal – 35 groups for various goods and 11 groups for different services. If you’re registering a trademark in Nepal, you need to know which of these groups (or “classes”) your product or service belongs to.


## Cost of Trademark Registration in Nepal

The application fee for trademark registration is NPR 1,000 (Approx. USD 10), while the registration fee is NPR 5,000 (Approx. USD 50). Once registered, a trademark remains valid for seven years from its registration date. However, it’s essential to remember to renew the trademark every seven years for continued Protection of your trade secrets.


## Grounds for Rejection of Trademark Registration

In Nepal, the Department of Industry (DOI) holds the authority to either accept or refuse a trademark application. Their decision is based on various criteria outlined in the country’s laws, specifically under section 18(1) of the Patent, Design, and Trademark Act (PDTA).

Prior Registration: If a trademark is found to have already been registered under someone else’s name, the DOI can refuse the new application. Essentially, this means no two entities can hold the same trademark.
Damaging Goodwill:The integrity and trust associated with a trademark are of prime importance. If a proposed trademark is perceived to harm the goodwill of another’s trademark, it can be a ground for refusal.
Harming Reputation: A trademark that might tarnish the reputation of any individual or institution is also not allowed. This ensures that trademarks can’t be misused to degrade someone else’s standing in the community.
Affecting Public Conduct or Morality:Trademarks play a vital role in public perception. If a proposed trademark goes against societal values or public morals, or jeopardizes the nation’s interest, the DOI can turn down the application.

## Conclusion

Foreign trademark registration in Nepal requires a thorough understanding of the process, necessary documentation, and legal grounds. As Trademark has become the Unique Selling Point of modern businesses, Foreign Trademarks are liable to be vulnerable in new markets such as that of Nepal and require a trusted law firm by your side.

This article makes clear the legal provision relating to the partition of the wife after the Husband’s death.


## Partition of Wife After Husband’s Death


## Widow’s Right to Partition Share

Partitionrefers to a division of ancestral property into parts; among the people who are legally entitled to the share of it i.e. coparceners. It is a process by which common owners of thepropertydivide it into multiple separate divisions to take their own share of the property.

As perMuluki Civil Code, 2074, for the purposes of apportionment of property in common, the husband, wife, father, mother, son, and daughter shall be deemed to be coparceners. Additionally, section 209 provides that a wife shall obtain partition share only from the part of her husband. That is to say, a wife is entitled to partition share from the part of her husband’s property.

However, confusion arises when a husband dies before the partition is effected; confusion as to whether the widow will receive any partition or not.


## Does the wife get partitioned after the Husband’s death?

Yes, a widow can rightfully claim partition share even after the death of her husband. Section 209 of the Muluki Civil Code provides that, If the husband, father, or mother dies before effecting partition, his wife or his or her child shall obtain the partition share to which the husband, father, or mother is entitled.


## What if the Widow gets Separated after Partition?

Our law allows a widow to get separated from the family upon obtaining partition at any time. Section 214 of the civil code states that a widow may get separated at any time by taking her partition share.


## What if a Widow Concludes another Marriage?

This can be studied under two conditions :

If any children are born from the previous husband ( the one who’s dead): The property that the widow had taken shall devolve back to previous children if the widow concludes second marriage.
If no children are born from the previous husband: She’s allowed to keep the property herself even after concluding thesecond marriagein case there are no children born from the previous husband.

- If any children are born from the previous husband ( the one who’s dead): The property that the widow had taken shall devolve back to previous children if the widow concludes second marriage.
- If no children are born from the previous husband: She’s allowed to keep the property herself even after concluding thesecond marriagein case there are no children born from the previous husband.

--- Content from https://meroadalat.com/property-rights-of-daughters-in-nepal/#more-928 ---

This article will focus on all the legal provisions relating to thepropertyrights of daughters in Nepal.

In general, the term ‘property’ means both tangible and intangible items in which a person obtains the right of ownership and possession. Thus, all the rights to use, invest in, consume, sell, and donate are related to property. The phrase ‘property rights’ refer to a body of rights the holder obtains over those tangible or intangible things. The right to own property essentially includes the right to dispose of it.

Hence, the establishment of women’s property rights means the following understandings:

Women’s capacity to hold ownership over the property, including their right to dispose of the property, independent of other’s consent or interference
Women’s capacity to hold possession over property, and all derivative rights under it
Women’s right to enjoy property through its ownership and possession
Women’s right to obtain a remedy upon the encroachment of their property rights

- Women’s capacity to hold ownership over the property, including their right to dispose of the property, independent of other’s consent or interference
- Women’s capacity to hold possession over property, and all derivative rights under it
- Women’s right to enjoy property through its ownership and possession
- Women’s right to obtain a remedy upon the encroachment of their property rights
If these rights are recognized and protected by law, a person’s capacity to own and possess the property is largely refined and is fully enforceable by law. Property rights must be available to both men and women without distinction on the basis of sex. The right of women to the property has been recognized as an important development issue.

Ownership of property empowers women and provides income and security. Secured property rights for women can have an impact on intra-household decision-making, income generation and acquisition, and women’s overall role and position in the household and community.

Earlier in Muluki ain, 1910 only legitimate wives were entitled to a full share of the ancestral property equal to males, whereas remarried widows, eloped daughters, and concubines could not claim the share of the ancestral property.

Muluki Ain 2020 changed the status of women in society and gave equal status to legitimately married women and eloped women. However, the 11th amendment in Muluki Ain 2020 was crucial for the daughter’s right to property. Furthermore, in many countries around the world, women’s property rights are limited by social norms and culture.

As a result, gender discrimination seems strongly related to lower per capita income, life expectancy, and literacy. Women may not fully participate in the benefits of property as members of a household if they do not share secured or formally recognized property rights over the land and/or housing.

Though there is a clear provision on sec 205 ofMuluki civil code, 2074where including wife and daughter are deemed to be considered as coparceners in partition, the reality is far from the letter of law.


## Legal Provision Regarding Property Rights of Daughters in Nepal

Art 18 (5) of the Constitution hold the equality norm that all offspring shall have the equal right to ancestral property without discrimination on the ground of gender.

Rights of women include every woman shall have equal lineage right without gender-based discrimination. The spouse shall have the equal right to property and family affairs.

Provision of property is incorporated in the National Civil Code, 2074. Any cash, good, or work shall be deemed to be a property if such cash, good, or work can be used or transacted or the title thereto can be transferred by way of purchase, sale, or otherwise or any benefit can be derived therefrom.

Likewise, the property shall be deemed to be in either movable or immovable form irrespective of its physical or non-physical, tangible or intangible form.

An Act made to amend and consolidate civil laws, which is National Civil Code in Nepal has also incorporated some of the important provisions relating to the right to property for women, including daughters, which can be studied as follows:

For the purpose to deem coparcener in a family, during the apportionment of property in common, the husband, wife, father, mother, son, and daughter are deemed to be coparceners.  Each coparcener is provisioned to have equal entitlement to partition share. Further, a widow can also affect separation at any time by taking her partition share.

It is mentioned if the widow concludes another marriage, the property obtained by her by way of partition share shall devolve on the son and daughter, if any, born to her from the previous husband and, if there is no such a son or daughter, she herself may retain such property.


## Conclusion

It is concluded that there is a direct correlation between women’s access to economic resources and physical abuse against them. If women are economically vulnerable, that exposes them to the dangers of physical abuse. Inequality in property rights is one of the causes of the vulnerability of girls and women to trafficking for sexual exploitation.

Polygamy, bigamy, and child marriage are other outcomes of the denial of equal property rights for women. Women’s backwardness in trade and commerce is obviously a result of inequality in property rights. A woman is fully empowered to dispose of property that is exclusively hers, or that she has earned by herself.

Is prostitution legal in Nepal? This article will help you to find out the legality of prostitution in Nepal.


## Is Prostitution Legal in Nepal?

Sex work is the practice of selling consensual sexual services in exchange for money or economic favors. Sex work, also interchangeably called prostitution or colloquial hooking, exists in all forms in all places and its legal status varies from state to state. Countries like the Netherlands, Germany, Argentina, Austria, and Bangladesh have liberal policies related to prostitution whereas countries like North Korea, Sudan, Iran, and Saudi Arabia consider prostitution a serious crime where the punishment is death if found guilty.

There is no uniformity among European nations regarding the legalization of prostitution. Even though illegal, it is practiced in various disguised forms in Nepal and neighboring countries like India, Bhutan, and Pakistan.

Sex work has always existed throughout history and civilizations. Prostitution, the controversial so-called “most ancient profession in the world”, raises moral and economic issues such as social stigma, health risks, and tax evasion. Although common to all, it is not considered a noble pursuit and has been looked down upon through the lens of public morality.

While some feminist argues that it proliferated along with the inequality within the patriarchal hierarchy, some philosophers think that promoting the abolition of prostitution confronts advocacy for laissez-faire.

Sex work remains a highly stigmatized taboo topic. No matter whatsoever expressions are used to define a –prostitute – in all their shade it has only reflected blame and stigma.

Prostitution or sex work has always been stigmatized and the persons who engage in such occupations have had to bear the brunt of the consequences that follow from such stigma and face discrimination, besides the emotional, mental, sexual, or physical trauma they may face.

Prostitution is illegal in Nepal under theHuman Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Actand criminalizes the act, and living off its earnings, by including it in the definition of human trafficking. However, prostitution has not been defined nor has it been recognized as an offense under the act.

The Supreme Court has interpreted prostitution as a profession “prostitution is a profession or occupation irrespective of whether it is legal or non-legal. However, the legal status of prostitution remains in dilemma. Exploiting this gray area of law, the number of people who are being introduced to sex work has magnified thrice fold, in recent observations.

Since prostitution is illegal in Nepal, brothel owners do so through massage parlors and dance bars rather than on the streets as they can be safe from police raids and also maintain their social status with better earnings. UNICEF estimates that 11,000 to 13,000 girls and women are working in the “night entertainment industry” in the Kathmandu Valley alone.

The Joint United Nations Program on HIV and AIDS suggests that there are about 49,000 prostitutes in the country living with underlying harassment, abuse, and crime. Nonregulation of sex work leaves room for exploitation and violence leaving many in vulnerable conditions.

Society seems to be divided on whether sex work should be decriminalized or remain criminalized. On one side of the spectrum, people consider sex work as immoral, degrading, and despicable work relating it to vulgarity and obscenity. Sex work is to be strictly criminalized and sex workers are to be punished.

This group believes in the eradication of prostitution which they consider a ‘problem’ or ‘disease’ in society. And, on the other side of the spectrum, people believe that decriminalization and legalization of sex work are the only way to solve the problems of sex work.

Sex work has always existed throughout history and hence to assume a sex work-free society in the future will only create more problems. The only way forward would be its legalization.


## Legal Provisions

According to Article 17(2f) ( Right to Freedom) of the Constitution of Nepal,

“Each person has …freedom to engage in any occupation or be engaged in employment, establish and operate industry, trade, and business in any part of Nepal.”

According to Article 33( Right to employment) ,

“Every citizen shall have the right to select employment”.

(1) No person shall solicit prostitution.

(2) A person who commits, or causes to be committed, the offense referred to in sub-section (1) shall be liable to a sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years and a fine not exceeding thirty thousand rupees.”

(1) No person shall knowingly provide his or her house, land, or means of transport for prostitution or having sexual intercourse with a prostitute.

(2) A person who commits the offense referred to in subsection (1) shall be liable to a sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or a fine not exceeding five thousand rupees or both sentences.

A person who does, or causes to be done, any act referred to in Section 211 or 212 shall be liable to a sentence of imprisonment for a term of seven to ten years and a fine of seventy-five thousand to one hundred thousand rupees.

If the person does or causes to be done, such act to cause death, causing injury by subjecting to hurt, committingrapeor unnatural sex, trafficking or enslaving, or subjecting to forced labor, engaging into prostitution, subjecting to torture, compelling to do or cause to be done any act, taking ransom or compelling to do any other act which constitutes any offense under the law in force, and to a sentence of imprisonment for a term of three to five years and a fine of thirty thousand to fifty thousand rupees if the person does, or causes to be done, such act for any other purpose.


## Conclusion

Using someone for prostitution or going in for prostitution is an act of trafficking that is punishable under the Human Trafficking and Transportation (Prevention) Act, of 2064.

Although the act of sex work itself is not specifically criminalized, sex workers may be prosecuted for other offenses. In practice, sex workers are most often arrested for public order offenses dealing with disturbing the peace or obscenity under the Some Public (Crime and Punishment ) Act, of 2027. Police also use this Act to raid parks and premises such as hotels and massage parlors where sex work is suspected.

Nepal has entertained very few cases regarding sex work, so there isn’t much substantial precedent laid down regarding sex work. However, the Supreme Court of Nepal has recognized the constitutional rights of sex workers.

In 2002, the Supreme Court of Nepal ruled that provisions of the criminal law that purported to apply a lighter penalty to rapists in cases where the survivor is a sex worker were unconstitutional and invalid.

The Court stated that: “prostitution is a profession or occupation irrespective of whether or not it is legal”. The Court held that sex workers should not be discriminated against in the criminal law concerning rape, given the constitutional rights to equality and to choose one’s profession.

After reading this article, you will be able to know the all information relating to animal rights law in Nepal.

Animal rights are moral principles grounded in the belief that non-human animals deserve the ability to live as they wish, without being subjected to the desires of human beings. At the core of animal rights is autonomy, which is another way of sayingchoice.

Human rights are rights inherent to all human beings, regardless of race, sex, nationality, ethnicity, language, religion, or any other status which include the right to life and liberty, freedom from slavery and torture, freedom of opinion and expression, the right to work and education, and many more.

Animal rights mean that animals deserve certain kinds of consideration, consideration of what is in their best interests, regardless of whether they are useful to humans, or an endangered species, and regardless of whether any human cares about them at all. It means recognizing that animals are not ours to use, for food, clothing, entertainment, or experimentation.

Animal exploitation involves the use of animals by humans for a variety of purposes, such as food production, usage as experimental subjects, or even as pets, which stands in direct contradiction to animal rights. Animal rights can also be violated when it comes to the human destruction of animal habitats. This negatively impacts the ability of animals to lead full lives of their choosing. Accepting the doctrine of animal rights means:

No experiments on animals
No breeding and killing of animals for food or clothes or medicine
No use of animals for hard labor
No selective breeding for any reason other than the benefit of the animal
No hunting
No zoos or use of animals in entertainment.

A person who commits, or causes to be committed, the said offense shall be liable to a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding one year or a fine not exceeding ten thousand rupees or both sentences.

It mentions that a person should not leave their bird/animal under their control in another’s home, land or public path, or public place. If a person fails, he/she will be liable to up to three months of imprisonment or a fine of up to five thousand or both.

Chapter 18 deals with offenses relating torape.

It prohibits bestiality which means no person shall have, or cause to be had, sexual intercourse with an animal. Sexual intercourse with a cow will amount to a punishment of 2 years imprisonment and a fine of up to two thousand. If other animals are raped, it is punishable by imprisonment for up to one year and a fine of up to ten thousand.

It protects cows and ox. It prohibits anyone from killing or injuring them or causing them to kill or injure them. The punishment for such an act is imprisonment for 3 years. If someone beats and injures a cow or ox causing them disability then such offender will be punished with 6 months of imprisonment, for other injuries will be punished with 6 months of imprisonment, and for another injury, they will be fined up to fifty thousand rupees.

However, killing cows and ox in the act of self-defense is not culpable.

It states that no one should act cruelly towards birds and animals. No one is allowed to beat, kick, over-drive, over-load or employ in any work orlaboror for any purpose any animal which, by reason of its age or any disease, infirmity, wound, sore or other cause is unfit to be so employed or administer any injurious substance to any animal or torture animal in any other way or abandon a domesticated animal in public due to the result of disease or old age or behave inhumane or cruelly in any other form.

But using minimum force in order to make any animal or bird do any work or carry a load according to its physical capacity or make it run, with the objective to teach or train it to do any work or make it efficient in its work is allowed.

A person who commits the offense aforementioned in Section 290 shall be liable to a sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or a fine not exceeding five thousand rupees or both sentences.

It prohibits the killing of birds and animals in public. It mentions that unless otherwise mentioned no animal is allowed to be killed in public unless such slaughtering has been done since time immemorial like in a fair, feast, exhibition, or event place, etc. The sacrifice of such animal or bird shall be done other

than in a religious place where the sacrifice of animals or birds has been in practice from time immemorial. If there is any other alternative other than sacrificing the animal it must be adopted and if there is no alternative it must be done as determined by the manager of the concerned religious place.

A person who commits, or causes to be committed, the offense referred to in this Section shall be liable to a sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding one month or a fine not exceeding five thousand rupees or both sentences.

It provides the time limitation for suits. Offenses under Section 290 have to be filled after the expiry of three months from the date of commission of such offense, and in relation to any of the other offenses under this Chapter, after the expiry of three months from the date of knowledge of the commission of such act.


## Acts Relating to Animal Rights in Nepal

Animal Health and Livestock Services Act, 2055
Animal Slaughterhouse and Meat Inspection Act, 2055
Nepal Veterinary Council Act, 2055(1999)

- Animal Health and Livestock Services Act, 2055
- Animal Slaughterhouse and Meat Inspection Act, 2055
- Nepal Veterinary Council Act, 2055(1999)

## Conclusions

Nepal through its legislation and policy has tried to approach the concept of animal right but the laws addressing animal right is not sufficient and the directive doesn’t have the same impact as statutes.

There is a requirement for a separate act that deals with the protection of animal rights and the prohibition of animal cruelty. Although Nepalese legislation is not progressive, whatever laws we have, we should focus on implementing as well as mending, consolidating, or codifying laws as per international standards.

In a developing country like ours, where the economy is still yet to be booming, the concern of the Government is diverted toward the commercial usage of animals. Animals are viewed as a byproduct of animal husbandry and a means for uplifting the economy: an opportunity for self-employment.

Nepal is a part of the global family so it needs to learn from other foreign provisions and adopt conventions relating to the animal right to ensure enough protection of animals.

This article is all about legal provisions relating to the banking offense through IT in Nepal.

“Banking” simply means accepting deposits of money from the general public for the goal of lending or investing, paid back on demand or otherwise, and mechanism for providing by cheque, draft, order, or even other means. Banks are among the financial system’s earliest financial intermediaries.

Banks and financial institutions play critical roles in the financial and economic systems of any nation. A very well banking system is a necessary prerequisite for flourishing international commerce, which enables connections with various countries. Any advanced economy’s support system is the banking sector.

It is one of the most essential principles of the financial system, and it plays a major part in an economy’s achievement or failure. Just a few years ago, the government implemented a policy of “one citizen: one bank account” to carry people in rural areas into the banking system and encourage the growth of financial institutions in remote regions.

However, as the number of banking service recipients increases, so does the likelihood of a banking offense occurring.

Essentially, a banking offense is any conduct in which the state’s banking laws levy criminal penalties in order to safeguard monetary sustainability and discipline.  The nation enforces criminal sanctions for actions such as cheque forgery and misuse of bank debt or other services.

In Nepal, these are among the most common banking offenses. The Nepalese government enacted the Banking Offence and Punishment Act in 2008 to mitigate the effects and risks that come with financial institutions and banks that may be resulted from potential offenses in banks and other financial institutions. Similarly, the act was put in place to increase public confidence in the banking structure.

There are various types of banking offenses. As enlisted by Banking Offence and Punishment Act some of them include: Opening an account or demanding cash payment in an unauthorized manner, making unauthorized withdrawals or payments, obtaining or making payment by way of abuse or unauthorized use of electronic means, making available or providing loans in an unauthorized manner, misusing credit facility, misusing banking resources, means and assets acquiring assets or opening account by the borrower having dues and so on.

The 21st century has seen the rise of some ground-breaking information technologies which have transformed our way of living. The notion of science and technological progression is not simply a portion of the present era; it serves as the fundamental basis of the innovative world of today and that we hope to create tomorrow.

Technological and scientific progression is the big aspect for advancement in disciplines like economic systems, health, education, communication, entertainment, as well as every field we can probably imagine of. So, it can be summed up that banking offenses are committed by the use of computers, computing networks, or any other electronic form.

Most essential functions of 21st-century civilization are intrinsically tied to digitalization, particularly the finance system, whose business model is based on consumer trust in the system as a whole.

The Internet has become the primary means of transferring funds among banks and other financial institutions; most customers use banking online to maintain their accounts and perform the majority of point-of-sale payment transactions. The more dependent the financial sector becomes on digital technology, the further intertwined it becomes and the more vulnerable it grows to technological oppression or exploitation.

Customers are largely responsible for favoring comfort over safety, and banking institutions convince users to use online technology to boost efficiencies and reduce their operating costs. The financial sector undergoes bigger losses from cyberattacks compared to any other field, apparently experiencing threats three times as often as other industries.

According to a recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) report, banks’ estimated yearly potential losses from cyberattacks could amount to 9% of their net revenue. In today’s globalized economy, the banking industry provides numerous services to its customers and users, including online banking and payment services.

Payment by debit card online Customers can use the internet and cell phones to reach all different kinds of bank facilities and they can handily transact and manage their account balances from any part of the globe.  These facilities, we all recognize, are advantageous to customers, however, they also get a dark side, which involves hackers and robberies.

## Legal provisions relating to the Banking Offense through IT in Nepal

Banking Offence in Nepal is regulated byBanking Offence and Punishment Act, 2064, and somehow by Asset Laundering Prevention Act, 2064 B.S., and Bank and Financial Institution Act, 2073 B.S. which is applicable both within Nepal and to individuals and institutions living overseas after having committed a banking offense in Nepal.

No person should obtain or make payment by the way of abuse or unauthorized use of a credit card, debit card, or any other electronic means.

Likewise, in the Bank and Financial Institution Act, of 2073 the term ‘electronic transaction’ has been defined as the business of accepting deposits, making a payment, and transferring money via telephone, telex, computers, magnetic tapes, or other similar electronic equipment, as well as transactions carried out via terminals, automated teller machines, and cash dispensing machines, as well as those carried out via charge cards, debit cards, or credit cards.


## Conclusion

A strong banking system is required for flourishing international trade and financial augmentation, which is increasing as a result of the flexural character of globalization and economic interconnectivity.

A national banking system connects the country to global trade. Henceforth, it can be concluded that the paradigm of banking offenses has shifted significantly since earlier days.

The majority of banking offenses are committed by gaining illegal or unauthorized access to bank information and then misconstruing that relevant data to transfer millions of rupees from one account to the other in a short amount of time. As a result, as technology advances, new types of banking crimes emerge.

Thus the regulation of banking offenses through IT in Nepal is the prime necessity today.

## Third Gender Right in Nepal

In Nepal, intersex persons are commonly called and understood as Hijada, chakka. They are called by different names in different geographical areas such as Fulu fulu in Mountain areas, Singaru in Western Hills, and Maugiya or Kothi in the Tarai region.

The blue diamond society is an LGBT rights organization in Nepal, established in 2001 to advocate for change in the existing laws against homosexuality and to advocate for the rights of sexual minority communities. Sunil Babu Pant is the first gay legislator in Nepal’s history.

Sunil Babu Pant and others vs. Nepal government and others,2007 (2064) is aground-breaking decision on Gender identity and sexual orientation, recognizing equal rights of sexual minorities, including equal recognition before the law.

The Supreme Court decision ordered the government to issue citizenship certificates or identity cards that allow the selection of third gender, i.e., “other” to identify an individual’s sex and gender.

Theconstitution of Nepal,2072includes several provisions pertaining to the rights of LGBT people.

–  right to have identity cards along with preferred gender identity (article 12)

– prohibition on discrimination on any ground including sex or sexual orientation by the State (article 18,3)

–  gender and sexual minority groups shall have the right to employment in state structure on the basis of the principle of proportional inclusion (article 42)

–   gender-neutral terms.

– the right of access to public services.

Nepal’s official documents afford its citizens three gender options to choose from: Male, Female, and Other. Court had ordered the authorities to amend laws to provide citizenship and passport certificates to the third gender people under the other or” O” category.

Nepal’s National Census 2011 was the first census in the world to allow people to register themselves as a gender other than Male or Female.

Manoj Shahi (Monica shahi), a transgender (MTF) of Kailali, is the first recipient of category “O” in Machine-Readable Passport (MRP) in Nepal.


## Same-Sex Marriage in Nepal

The court asked the Government to form a committee to study same-sex partnership laws in other countries and mandated that the new law not discriminate against sexual minorities;(Sunil Babu Pant and Others v. Nepal Government)

In January 2014, a committee was formed by the government to study international laws on same-sex marriage and prepare the report

In October 2016, the Ministry of Women, Children, and Social Welfare set up a committee for preparing a draft bill on the issue.

But same-sex marriage is not legalized in Nepal.

In July 2017, a couple successfully registered theirmarriagein the Dadeldhura District of far-western Nepal.


## Muluki Civil Code 2074

Provisions relating to civil rights are mentioned in Chapter 3 of Muluki Civil Code 2074. According to section 17, every citizen shall be equal before the law and no citizen shall be deprived of equal protection of the law. Likewise, no discrimination shall be made in the application of general law on grounds of origin, religion, color, caste, race, sex, physical condition, or on similar other grounds as mentioned in section 18.

No person shall discriminate in any public and private place on grounds of origin, religion, color, caste, race, sex, physical condition or on similar other ground; and no person shall, on such ground, be prevented from using service, amenities or utilities of public use or from entering into a public place or public religious place or from performing religious act according to his or her will.

In terms of pay and social security benefits for the same work, no one may be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation. Any citizen may be appointed to a governmental or public office, but only on the basis of the qualifications specified by the law. No citizen shall be discriminated against in making such an appointment on the basis of national origin, religion, color, caste, race, sex, or similar other considerations.


## Muluki Criminal Code 2074

Chapter 10 of muluki criminal code 2074 deals with the offense relating to discrimination and other degrading treatment. Section 160 prohibits making discriminatory treatment in any sense. Any authority that wields legal authority is not allowed to intentionally treat any citizen unfairly based on their place of origin, religion, color, caste, race, sex, physical condition, disability, state of health, or any other comparable grounds unless expressly permitted by law.

A penalty of imprisonment for a term not to exceed three years, a fine not to exceed thirty thousand rupees, or both sentences, may be imposed on a person who commits or causes to be committed the offense. Likewise, there is a legal provision not to abort after finding out the gender of the child.

According to section 188 (7), no person shall, with the intention of causing abortion, do, or cause to be done, any act by which the sex of the fetus is identified, and abort or cause abortion following such sex identification. Rape is a heinous offense that is prohibited and its prohibition is provided in section 219. Where a man has sexual intercourse with a woman without her consent or with a girl child below eighteen years of age even with her consent, the man shall be considered to commit rape on such woman or girl child.

Likewise, unnatural sexual intercourse is also considered to be a criminal offense. Without the other person’s consent, no one may engage in or cause to engage in unnatural sexual activity. A sentence of imprisonment for a term not to exceed three years and a fine not to exceed 30,000 rupees are the penalties for the offense.


## Legal Status of Third Gender Rights

In the context of Nepal, although the third-gender community has gotten legal recognition and is entitled to fundamental rights by law, still there is a lot to improve. Following the historic ruling in Sunil Babu Pant v. Government of Nepal, Nepal gained a reputation as Asia’s most progressive nation when it came to recognizing the rights of third-gender groups.

In Nepal, the LGBTQ community is referred to as Sexual and Gender Minorities. The rights of LGBTQ people have been recognized by the courts and by the constitution, but they continue to face administrative and bureaucratic burdens, as well as a lack of inclusive legislative measures, which limit their ability to fully exercise their fundamental rights. In September 2015, several articles mentioning LGBTI rights in the country’s new Constitution were approved by Parliament after lengthy deliberation. They are ensured with fundamental rights such as the right to equality, the right to social justice e.t.c. which had third gender-friendly provisions.

The Constitution’s recognition of transgender people’s right to self-determination and the inclusion of their preferred names and gender markers in all official identity documents is their most notable right. Article 12 states that people have the right to have citizenship ID that reflects their preferred gender. Similarly, as mentioned in Article 18, the state cannot discriminate against any people on the basis of their gender and sex. The state also has the obligation in making special laws for the protection, empowerment, and advancement of gender and sexual minority groups.

Article 18 also lists LGBTI people among disadvantaged groups that are recognized by the Constitution and need protection from the state. Article 42 lists “gender and sexual minorities” among groups that will have the right to participate in state mechanisms and public services based on the “principle of inclusion” (Right to social justice).

The new Constitution, approved by the Constituent Assembly on 16 September 2015, includes several provisions pertaining to the rights of LGBT people but does not address same-sex marriage. Foreign same-sex spouses of Nepali citizens are eligible for a “Non-Tourist Visa” as a dependent, following a 2017 ruling by the Supreme Court of Nepal in the case of Suman Panta v. Ministry of Home Affairs.


## Social Status of Third Gender Rights

Third Gender is usually out of the mainstream gender discourse and they face acuteneglect and discrimination because of their gender which makes it the most alienated and deprived gender, even more than women. Nepal being a developing country grounded by traditional practices and religious beliefs still looks upon third-gender groups in a derogatory way as a taboo. Progressive thoughts exist within the new generation but it’s really hard to educate society as a whole on this matter.

There exists law for their protection and upliftment but the societal perspective towards them is so disturbing and demeaning. However, we cannot expect the change to come overnight and the scenario seems to be gradually evolving. However, in Nepal, third-gender people have been socially recognized and have an important role in society.

They are seen as people who have the power to bless others with luck and prosperity. They are commonly called Hijada. As per Blue Diamond Society, they are known by different names in different geographical areas such as Fulufulu in the Mountain areas, Singaru in Western Hills, and Maugiya or Kothi in the Terai region. They are also known as metis (who are assigned male at birth but dress and behave as female). They have an important role at weddings and at the birth of children to bless and ward off evil spirits.

They are traditionally regarded as people having religious power to bless other people. Among Gurung people, there is a tradition of men dancing in female clothing, called maarunis, typically at barracks or at royal palaces, and are believed to bring good luck.With time, we can see the changes going on in our county and in the minds of its citizen. People have started accepting their sexual orientation, social media is helping to promote awareness on this topic, there are a bunch of individuals out there who advocate for their recognition and equality who support them.

On the other hand, there also exists certain groups of individual who refers to their sexual orientation as taboo and find third-gender group of people insulting and bad impact on society. This social stigma is still rooted deep in Nepalese society. Marriage in Nepal is a religious and cultural institution rather than a civil one. It is the foundation for creating a family. So, same-sex marriage is not accepted by society. Men who have sex with men are frequently also married to women, and a procreative marriage is considered a successful one, whatever the sexual desires of the partners. Even though LGBTQ people have been recognized traditionally throughout Nepal, acceptance and acknowledgment of homosexuality and same-sex marriage are relatively new.

Families often keep homosexuality secret for the fear of shame. Before the third gender people were suppressed to another level, their voices were unheard, and they were humiliated for being the way they are and who they are, and some people often referred to their identity as a disease.

Even the state gave no recognition to them. After the remarkable case of Sunil Babu Pant v. Nepal Goverment and others, the third-gender groups were given legal rights to identify themselves and enjoy their rights without discrimination. Since then, societal dynamics have changed and efforts are being put together for their upliftment.


## Conclusion

Third-gender right in Nepal is the essential right that is needed to be provided to third-gender people. Every human being is equal and they are free to enjoy every human right despite their gender. So third-gender rights must be effectively provided to the people.  It’s our responsibility to respect each person’s freedom to self-identify as to their gender and sexual orientation. The state shall oppose homophobic and transphobic violence, therefore legal recognition and protection from the state are crucial for people to live with dignity and freedom in society.

This article will help you to know all about the law relating to surrogacy in Nepal.

As absurd as it sounds, from an evolutionary perspective the meaning of human life is associated with gene propagation; the creation of babies. Respecting individuals’ differences and personal choices, marriage is such an institution that legally allows one to have a child.

However, there may be complications due to a woman’s illness, inability to give birth, sexual impotency of either partner, or any other health reasons. For such couples, the only way of having a child is either through legal adoption or a miracle of reproductive science (surrogacy).

Surrogacy is a fertility treatment in which a woman carries and delivers pregnancy for another couple. It is an arrangement, often supported by legal agreement, to bear a child for another person or person(s). It is a method of assisted reproduction that helps intended parents start or grow families when they can’t do so on their own.

Britannica Encyclopedia defines surrogate motherhoodas a practice in which a woman (the surrogate mother) bears a child for a couple unable to produce children in the usual way, usually because the wife is infertile or otherwise unable to undergo pregnancy.


## Types of Surrogacy

Traditional Surrogacy:  the surrogate mother is impregnated through artificial insemination with the sperm of the husband.
Gestational surrogacy:  the wife’s ova and the husband’s sperm are subjected to in vitro fertilization, and the resulting embryo is implanted in the surrogate mother.

- Gestational surrogacy:  the wife’s ova and the husband’s sperm are subjected to in vitro fertilization, and the resulting embryo is implanted in the surrogate mother.
Altruistic Surrogacy: women agree to hold the baby in their womb for social service
Commercial Surrogacy: is done for commercial benefit and it has been banned in most countries.

It is to be noted that surrogacy is not a right but only a last resort for –

A heterosexual couple who have struggled with fertility
Intended mothers who are unable to carry a child
Intended parents who have a genetic defect or health condition they don’t want to pass onto the child
Same-sex parents who want to have a genetic link to the baby

- Intended mothers who are unable to carry a child

Only surrogacy that is done for welfare purposes, consensual and non-commercial is legally accepted. Nowhere in the world is surrogacy allowed for commercial purposes as it involves matters of the surrogate mother’s reproductive health and rights, ethics and morality attached to it, and matters of its exploitation. The sensitivity of surrogacy is so much so that it has been legally authorized only in a few countries and only for non-commercial purposes with proper regulatory mechanisms.


## Law Relating to Surrogacy in Nepal

In the case of Nepal, surrogacy services have been banned since 2015. As of now, there are no laws to deal with surrogacy issues.

Two writ petitions had been filed in relation to the commercialization of surrogacy in 2072 namely Pushpa Raj Pandey v Office of Prime Minister, Ministry of Health and Population including others (writ no. 072-WO-0119) and Prabin Pandak v Office of Prime Minister and others ( writ no. 072-WO-0120 ). The writs were filed to declare the cabinet’s decision of 2071/6/2 void which allowed hospitals to practice surrogacy based onNational Health Policy 2071policy no 12 (as per which fertility shall be managed by the surrogacy-related laws ). In absence of proper law and mechanisms, it would have negative effects on women’s reproductive rights leading to violence, exploitation, and trafficking.

Supreme Court gave interim order not to execute the decision made by the cabinet until the final order. Since surrogacy raises a number of legal questions, it may not be practiced without determining such questions and hence ordered the hospitals to ban the service of surrogacy.

Soon after the interim order, Cabinet declared its earlier decision allowing surrogacy void.

In the final decision, Supreme Court  gave a directive order to the concerned authority to make an appropriate law to regulate surrogacy in Nepal considering the following fact :

Completely ban commercial surrogacy since a mother’s womb can never be commercialized.
If a Nepali married couple has been certified by a medical board that they are incapable of producing children because of infertility or other health conditions, they should be allowed.
Same-sex couples or single men and women shall not be allowed to practice surrogacy
Foreigners are not to be allowed to practice surrogacy in Nepal
The mutual consent of the intended married couple and surrogate is required
Only for altruistic and non-commercial purposes
Criteria for surrogate mother
Service to be provided by health institutions that fulfill criteria as prescribed by the law upon taking consent of the such authority
Both the intended couple or surrogate has to apply to the concerned authority first
Determination of legal rights and duties of legal parents
Determination of rights and duties of surrogate mother
Clarity on registration of birth and other events
Provision of institutions for supervision, monitoring, and inspection of whether laws have complied with or not

Despite the directive order, no efforts have been made in regard to surrogacy. This reflects the reluctance of parliament in this matter.

This article will help you to know about the homicide law in Nepal. It will help you to sort out the curiosity about the questions like how much imprisonment punishment is there if someone kills a person or what type of killing imposes greater punishment and what type imposes lesser punishment or what type does not impose any punishment.

Homicide law in Nepal is governed byMuluki Criminal Code 2074. That is why homicide law in Nepal plays vital role to protect fundamental and human rights.

Crimes related to life are traditional crimes and of the most serious nature. As a result of this crime, a man’s life unnaturally ends before his/her natural death.

In human life, the most essential thing is his/her own life. As the life of such a person is unique in itself and once a person’s life is lost, it cannot be restored.

Homicide, whether it is legal or illegal, is a homicide. All homicides are not crimes. Crime against human life is taken as the most serious and sensitive crime because it ends the existence of humans in the global world.

It is the responsibility of the state to protect the life of people within its territory, which is why every country criminalizes homicide and attempt to murder and provides the highest punishment sanctioned by their national legal system.

The law provides different punishments for such murderers based on the different mental states and intentions of the murderer.

It means unlawful homicide is of different kinds such as heinous homicide, genocide, and prevocational homicide. There is a tendency to classify unlawful homicide on the basis of the level of mental condition in which certain human beings are killed, intentionally or unintentionally or through knowledge, negligence or carelessness.

## Gender Equation in Partitionof Property in Nepal

The Supreme Court and the movement of women have played an important role in the establishment of rights of women for property in partition and family matters. In the Nepalese Constitution, the subject of family matters and the right of the couple and equal rights of the daughter to the ancestral property are included under fundamental rights.

Especially the steps taken by Advocate Mira Kumari Dhungana for the achievement of equal rights to property in partition for sons and daughters in the year 2052 have been proved to be a milestone in the field of rights of women in Nepal.

Similarly, there has been a total change in the provision of the married daughter getting the property in the partition from the husband and the subject of the daughter getting the part of the property in the partition has been guaranteed for married women after 2074.

It has been guaranteed that any woman can live separately by acquiring the property in the partition from the husband after themarriageand she has monopoly rights on the property she has acquired as such.

The inclusion of the equal rights of the couple in the matters of property and family life in the Constitution has guaranteed the participation of women in every family matter, and the use, utilization, and acquisition of property.

As such the economic rights of the woman have been guaranteed. Similarly, the woman has monopoly rights on her earnings and the property acquired before and after the marriage.


## For Answer and Question

If a woman coparcener is pregnant at the time of partition and the baby to be delivered by her is to become a coparcener, partition shall be made by treating also such would be born baby as a coparcener and only after setting aside his or her partition share of the property.

The husband, wife, father, mother, son, anddaughter are liable for the partition of property.

A son and daughter whose father is not traced out shall obtain their partition share from the property belonging to their mother only.

If a person concludes anothermarriageor a child is born from the wife so married, such a wife, son or daughter shall obtain her or his partition share only from the part of the property of the husband or father respectively.

If there is a mutual agreement between the coparcener, they may get separated at any time by obtaining their respective partition share.If the husband, father, mother, or person acting as the head of the family thinks it appropriate for the coparcener to obtain their respective partition share and get divided rather than living in a single family, the coparcener may get separated by effecting partition at any time.

The husband or wife may, in any of the following circumstances, get separated at any time by obtaining his or her partition share:(a) If the husband or wife expels the wife or husbandfrom the house,(b) If the husband or wife causes physical or mentaltorture to the wife or husband.

A widow may get separated at any time by taking her partition share.If a widow concludes another marriage, the propertyobtained by her by way of partition share shall devolve on the sonand daughter, if any, born to her from the previous husband and, ifthere is no such a son or daughter, she may retain suchproperty.

If a person who is not entitled to receive a partition share is held to have filed a lawsuit for receiving it, the court shall order the law-suit filing person to pay to the defendant a reasonable compensation, having regard to the amount in controversy, if setout from the case-file, and if such amount is not set out, to thestatus of such a person.


## Conclusion

Partition means the division of ancestral property between the coparceners of the same family. The idea is that the right to property is acquired from birth and it is accepted that any coparcener should not be deprived of it.

As the basis is created for the maintenance of the family and its economic development and expansion is created within the right of property, it is seen as an important right in Nepali society, which creates or helps to create, a necessary basis for the life of the individual.

--- Content from https://meroadalat.com/sexual-harassment-law-in-nepal/#more-619 ---

This article will help you to know about sexual harassment law in Nepal.

Sexual harassment is a type of harassment involving the use of explicit or implicit sexual overtones, including unwelcome and inappropriate promises of rewards in exchange for sexual favors. Sexual harassment includes a range of actions from verbal transgressions to sexual abuse or assault.

Acts of sexual assault are mostly committed by teenagers and young men, but people of all ages commit sexual assault. And the offenders may be of either sex. The perpetrator does not have to be of the opposite sex.

Sexual harassment often involves bullying or coercion, and the harassers typically have social or economic power over the victim.

Sexual harassment or assault crimes usually involve motives of dominance or control rather than sexual gratification; it is a crime of violence, not a crime of passion.

Sexual harassment has been categorized as:

1. Physical sexual harassment,

2. Verbal sexual harassment,

3. Written sexual harassment,

4. Conduct-related sexual harassment.


## Various Situations of Sexual Harassment

Sexual harassment may occur in a variety of situations: workplaces as varied as factories, schools/colleges, academia, business houses, etc.

The perpetrator can be anyone, such as a client, a co-worker, a legal guardian, a relative, a teacher or professor, a student, a friend, or a stranger.

Often, but not always, the perpetrator is in a position of power or authority over the victim (due to differences in age, or social, political, educational, or employment relationships).


## Some Examples of Sexual Harassment:

Unwanted sexual statements:Sexual or “dirty” jokes, comments on physical attributes, spreading rumors about or rating others as to sexual activity or performance, talking about one’s sexual activity in front of others, and displaying or distributing sexually explicit drawings, pictures, and/or written material. Unwanted sexual statements can be made in person, in writing, electronically (email, instant messaging, blogs, web pages, etc.), and otherwise.

Unwanted personal attention:Letters, telephone calls, visits, pressure for sexual favors, pressure for unnecessary personal interaction, and pressure for dates where a sexual/romantic intent appears evident but remains unwanted.

This article will help you to know all about intellectual property in Nepal, its types, nature, and scope.

Intellectual property (IP) is defined as the creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; symbols, names, and images used in commerce.

These rights are mentioned in Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which provides for the right to benefit from the protection of moral and material interests resulting from authorship of scientific, literary, or artistic productions.

Intellectual property (IP) is a category of property that includes intangible creations of the human intellect.

Intellectual property rights reward creativity and human endeavor, which fuels the progress of humankind. Intellectual property in Nepal is governed by thepatent, design, and trademark act 2022.


## Establishment of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)

The convention establishing the WIPO was signed in Stockholm in 1967 and entered into force in 1970. However, the origin of WIPO goes back to 1883- the Paris Convention on industrial property and 1886- the Berne Convention on copyright. Both were placed under the supervision of the Swiss Federal Government. Initially, there were two secretaries (one for industrial property, and the other for copyright). However, in 1893 the two secretaries united. United International Bureaux for the Protection of IP (BIRPI) became WIPO.

WIPO is a largely self-financed organization, generating more than 90 percent of its annual budget through its widely used international registration and filing systems, as well as through its publications and arbitration and mediation services. The remaining funds come from contributions by the Member States.


## Scope of Intellectual Property Rights

Intellectual property rights include copyright, patent, trademark, the geographic indication of origin, industrial design, trade secrets, database protection laws, publicity rights laws, laws for the protection of plant varieties, laws for the protection of semiconductor chips (which store information for later retrieval), etc.

There is a conventional mode of classification of intellectual property as industrial property and copyrights. Industrial properties include inventions (patents), property interest on the minor invention (Utility model certificate) and commercial interests (Trade Marks, trade names, geographical indications, and industrial design), plant breeder rights, biodiversity, etc.


## Nature of Intellectual Propertyin Nepal

Territorial:Intellectual property laws are mainly territorial and apply only within the relevant competence.  The TRIPS agreement  (The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) has the minimum standard in its respective municipal laws for all nations, the IP laws around the world are not harmoniously united.

Givingan exclusive right to theowner:It means others, who are not owners, are prohibited from using the right. The creator or author of intellectual property enjoys rights inherent in his work to the exclusion of anybody else.

Assignable:Intellectual property can be bought, sold, licensed or hired, or attached.

Independence:Different intellectual property rights subsisting on the same kind of object. Most intellectual property rights are likely to be embodied in objects.

Copyright law gives creators of original material the exclusive right to further use and duplicate that material for a given amount of time, at which point the copyrighted item becomes public domain.

Copyright does not protect ideas, discoveries, concepts, or theories. Brand names, logos, slogans, domain names, and titles also cannot be protected under copyright law.

For an original work to be copyrighted, it has to be in tangible form. This means that any speech, discoveries, musical scores, or ideas have to be written down in physical form in order to be protected by copyright.

Apatentis an exclusive right granted for an invention – a product or process that provides a new way of doing something, or that offers a new technical solution to a problem.

A patent provides patent owners with protection for their inventions. Protection is granted for a limited period, generally 20 years. For example, the patent for the personal computer was filed in 1980 by Steve Jobs and three other colleagues at Apple Inc.

There are three different categories that patents can fall under:

Utility: A utility patent protects the creation of a new or improved product, process, composition of matter, or machine that is useful.

Design:  A design patent protects the ornamental design of a useful item.

Plant:  A plant patent protects new kinds of plants produced by cuttings or other nonsexual means.

The termtrademarkrefers to a recognizable insignia, phrase, word, or symbol that denotes a specific product and legally differentiates it from all other products of its kind.

A trademark exclusively identifies a product as belonging to a specific company and recognizes the company’s ownership of the brand.

A trademark is an easily recognizable symbol, phrase, or word that denotes a specific product. It legally differentiates a product or service from all others of its kind and recognizes the source company’s ownership of the brand.

Trademarks may or may not be registered and are denoted by the ® and ™ symbols respectively. Although trademarks do not expire, the owner must make regular use of them in order to receive the protections associated with them.

--- Content from https://meroadalat.com/second-marriage-in-nepal/#more-484 ---

This article will help you know all the information about the law related to second marriage in Nepal.

Marriageis a legally, formally, and morally recognized union of two people as partners in a personal relationship. Section 68 of the NationalCivil Code, 2074 B.S., envisions marriage as a permanent, inviolable, and holy social and legal bond, which is based on free consent and established to start conjugal and family life between a man and a woman.Marriage is a holy bond that has been corrupted and violated since time immemorial. The deviation from the established norms and legal frameworks of marriage is deemed to be an offense related to marriage, among which the most frequent and prevalent offense is bigamy.

Second marriage in Nepal is not only immoral but also illegal and punishable by law. In a country like Nepal, where family structure, rituals, customs, traditions, as well as law, are largely influenced by Hindu Jurisprudence, bigamy irreversibly deteriorates, permanently destroys, and irreparably damages the conjugal relationship.

Bigamy is a crime in most countries that recognize only monogamous marriages. Bigamy is the unlawful contracting of marriage by or with a person who is already married to another.

Bigamy refers to the act of entering into a marriage with one person while still legally married to another. Where a person commits bigamy, often neither the first nor the second spouse is aware of the other. Bigamy is one of the main reasons for conjugal infidelity.

According to Black’s Law Dictionary, “Bigamy is the criminal offense of willfully and knowingly contracting a second marriage (or going through the form of a second marriage) while the first marriage is still legally valid.”

Law related to second marriage in Nepal is guided by the Muluki Civil Code 2074 as well as theMuluki Criminal Code 2074.


## Legal Provisions Regarding Second Marriage in Nepal

The law related to second marriage in Nepal has been enshrined both in the National Civil Code as well as National Penal Code as follows:

According to Section 71(2)(e) of the National Civil Code, 2074 B.S., “No one shall conclude, or cause to be concluded,marriagewith a man or a woman who is already married, by way of misrepresentation.” Furthermore, Section 71(3) empowers a person who is aggrieved by the conclusion of a marriage by way of misrepresentation with a person who is already married to other people to get such a marriage voided and claim reasonable compensation from the person who concludes or causes to be concluded, marriage by misrepresentation.

The act of bigamy is prohibited and punishable as per Section 175 of the National Penal Code as follows:

Section 175: Prohibition of bigamy:

(1) No married man shall, during the continuation of themaritalrelationship, conclude another marriage.

(2) No woman shall conclude marriage with a man knowing that he is already married.

(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1) or (2), a man or woman may marry again if the husband and wife have separated upon making apartitionby law.

(4) A person who commits, or causes to be committed, the offense referred to in subsection (1) or (2) shall be liable to a sentence of imprisonment for a term of one year to five years and a fine of ten thousand to fifty thousand rupees.

(5) The marriage referred to in sub-section (1) shall, ipso facto, be void.

(6) Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this Section, nothing contained in this Section shall be deemed to affect any marriage concluded by the law in force for the time being before the commencement of this Act.


## Statute of Limitation for Second Marriage in Nepal

Section 176 of the National Penal Code provides that, “No complaint about bigamy shall lie after the expiry of three months from the date of knowledge of the commission of the offense.” Hence, the charge sheet shall be registered in the court within 3 months of the knowledge of the offense of bigamy.


## Procedural Aspect of the Offence of Bigamy

According to Schedule 1(1)(a)(10) of the National Penal Code, 2074 B.S., bigamy is a government plaintiff case that is prosecuted by the Government Attorney on behalf of the victim.

The victim has to complain and communicate the details of the case to the police in the form of a First Information Report (F.I.R.) under Section 4 of the National Criminal Procedure Code, 2074 B.S. The concerned police officer investigates the offense and prepares a case file, which is sent to the concerned District Government Attorney’s Office.

If in view of the proof and evidence collected, the concerned government attorney considers that there is adequate evidence for instituting the case, the concerned government attorney shall prepare a charge sheet in the form referred to in Schedule 20 and shall submit the charge sheet to the concerned District Court within the time limit.


## Case of Idris Maya

The Supreme Court in the case of Government of Nepal vs Idris Miya held that bigamy is contrary to the established legal, moral, and religious framework and principles, and extra-territorial jurisdiction can be invoked with regard to the offense of bigamy.


## Conclusion

Hence, second marriage in Nepal is a category of offense against marriage that has been in practice in Nepalese society since time immemorial, and in the present time has been prohibited, punished, as well as forbidden by civil as well as criminal laws in force.

--- Content from https://meroadalat.com/law-relating-to-domestic-violence-in-nepal/#more-463 ---

This article will help you to know all about the law relating to domestic violence in Nepal.

Domestic violence is any form of physical, sexual, emotional, or economic abuse where there is a close relationship between the victim and the offender usually in co-habilitation. There is usually a power gap between them. The victim is dependent on the offender.

United Nations defines domestic violence as a pattern of behavior in any relationship that is used to gain or maintain power and control over an intimate partner. Abuse is physical, sexual, emotional, economic, or psychological actions or threats of actions that influence another person. This includes any behaviors that frighten, intimidate, terrorize, manipulate, hurt, humiliate, blame, injure, or wound someone.

In the context of Nepal, domestic violence is one of the most reported crimes among other gender-based crimes. So we can say that law relating to domestic violence in Nepal plays a vital role in controlling it. Although a person of any gender, caste, age, the economic and educational background can be a victim of domestic violence women hold the majority place as the victim.

According to the report of Nepal Police (2077/78) women of age 26-35 who have received basic education are the victims of the majority of domestic violence cases registered.

Along with many international instruments, Nepal has enforced the law relating to domestic violence in Nepal such as theDomestic Violence (Offence and Punishment) Act, 2066,and theDomestic Violence (Offence and Punishment) Rules, 2067.


## Law Relating to Domestic Violence in Nepal


## Domestic Violence (Offence and Punishment) Act, 2066

It is an essential law relating to domestic violence in Nepal. Section 2 (a) of the Act defines domestic violence as any form of physical, mental,sexual, and economic harm perpetrated by a person to a person with whom he/she has a family relationship and this word also includes any acts of reprimand or emotional harm.

An act of committing or causing bodily harm or injury holding as a captive, inflicting physical pain, or any other activity connected therewith and incidental thereto except the act of breaking the limbs of the body.

Any act of threatening the Victim with physical torture, showing terror, reprimanding him/her, accusing him/her of false blame, forcefully evicting him/her from the house, or otherwise causing injury or harm to the Victim emotionally and this expression also includes any discrimination carried out on the basis of thought, religion or culture and customs and traditions.

Sexual misbehavior, humiliation, discouragement, or harm to the self-respect of any person; or any other act that hampers safe sexual health.

Deprivation from using jointly or privately owned property or deprivation of or access to employment opportunities, economic resources, or means.

Section 13 of the same act provides for the punishment to the offender of domestic violence as:

A fine of three thousand rupees up to twenty-five thousand rupees or six months of imprisonment or both to anyone who commits the offense.
Half of the punishment is that of the offender to anyone who attempts to commit domestic violence or abets the crime or incites others to commit the crime.
Double punishment upon every repetition of the offense to the person who has been punished once for the offense of domestic violence.
An additional ten percent of the punishment is to the person who commits the offense of domestic violence while holding a public post.

- A fine of three thousand rupees up to twenty-five thousand rupees or six months of imprisonment or both to anyone who commits the offense.
- Half of the punishment is that of the offender to anyone who attempts to commit domestic violence or abets the crime or incites others to commit the crime.
- Double punishment upon every repetition of the offense to the person who has been punished once for the offense of domestic violence.
- An additional ten percent of the punishment is to the person who commits the offense of domestic violence while holding a public post.

## Relevant Questions and Answers

Any person who has knowledge of an act of domestic violence that has been committed or is being committed, or is likely to be committed may file a complaint against the offender to the concerned authority. In the case of domestic violence,locus standiis not relevant and hence anyone including the victim may file a complaint.

Anyone may file a written or oral complaint to the Police Station, National Women’s Commission, or Local Body. One may file a complaint by using the various helpline numbers such as:

-100 Nepal Police for reporting any offenses-1145 “Khabar Garau” helpline of National Women Commission in case of gender-based violence or violence against women-1098 Child helpline number for reporting child abuse including child domestic abuse.

Although the majority of the cases reported are of domestic violence against women, anyone of any gender, age, race, or caste may be a victim of domestic violence by their spouse, parents, siblings, relatives, or intimate partners.

Domestic violence is a more sensitive offense than other physical, sexual, or economic abuse as usually both the victim and the offender are living under a safe roof and the victim is dependent economically, emotionally, or socially on the offender.


## Conclusion

Domestic violence is more prevalent in our society than we like to think. The law relating to domestic violence in Nepal is not as effective in addressing this issue as it should be because the victims of this type of offense are dependent on their offender and taking any legal actions against them only worsens their living situation.

The concerned authority along with various organizations may be able to address this issue by helping the victims and offenders by providing them with proper rehabilitation. This can be done by proper research about the cause of the said crime and its effect on the victims and their offenders.
